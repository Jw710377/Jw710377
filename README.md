- Hi, I'm Jacob Wood
- I'm currently studying Computer Engineering
- I chose my major because working with computers has been a hobby of mine for nearly all of my life
- A fun fact about me is:  I've lived in Alaska most of my life and plan to move back after college
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  I want to leave this course with the ability to use C programming languages in personal and professional projects.
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  How to Build a Car by Adrien Newey, phenomenal book if you're at all interested in Formula 1, technical development, or just want an entertaining autobiography.
